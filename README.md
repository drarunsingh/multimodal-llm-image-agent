# Prompt-Engineered Multimodal LLM Agent for Image-Based Interpretation

## Overview

This repository showcases a **working multimodal LLM application** built using
**Flowise** and **OpenAI’s vision-capable models**.

The system accepts user-uploaded images and generates structured, natural-language
interpretations using **prompt engineering and agent orchestration**.

The project is intentionally designed to demonstrate **applied Generative AI
engineering**, focusing on:
- Multimodal LLM usage
- Agentic workflow design
- Prompt constraints and guardrails
- Responsible and transparent AI behavior

## What This Project Is 

### ✅ This project demonstrates:
- Prompt-engineered multimodal reasoning
- Agent orchestration using Flowise
- Image-to-text interpretation using OpenAI Vision APIs
- Structured and constrained LLM outputs
- Real-world GenAI application design


## System Architecture

The system follows a **agent-based architecture**:

1. User uploads an image through the interface
2. Image is passed directly to an OpenAI multimodal model
3. A carefully designed **system prompt** constrains:
   - Reasoning scope
   - Output structure
   - Tone and safety boundaries
4. The agent generates a structured response
5. Final interpretation is returned to the user

## Technologies Used

- **Flowise** – agent orchestration and workflow management  
- **OpenAI Vision API** – multimodal image understanding  
- **Prompt Engineering** – reasoning control and output guardrails  
- **Agentic Design** – modular, explainable AI system construction

## Responsible AI & Limitations

This system follows **responsible AI principles**:

- Outputs are **interpretative**, not deterministic
- No medical, legal, or predictive claims are made
- Image quality limitations are explicitly acknowledged
- Reasoning is constrained via prompt design

### Known Limitations
- Behavior depends on the underlying LLM
- Interpretations may vary across similar inputs

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how **modern multimodal LLMs can be safely orchestrated**

It highlights practical GenAI skills relevant to:
- Rapid prototyping
- AI-powered user interfaces
- Agent-based system design
- Production-aware prompt engineering
